# kohactive's JavaScript Style Guide



[**Whitespace**](whitespace.md): Probably a good thing to read up on before checking anything else out. Most whitespace rules are enforced by linter and can usually be fixed with ESLint's `--fix` option, but they're good to know anyway

[**Naming Conventions**](naming.md): Guidelines on how to name variables, functions, files, etc.

[**Strings**](strings.md): TL;DR We use double quotes and template strings

[**Functions**](functions.md): Preferred styles for fat arrows, promises and more

[**Arrays**](arrays.md): Preferred syntax and methods for creating, mutating, and parsing arrays

[**Objects**](objects.md): Preferred syntax and styles for dealing with objects
